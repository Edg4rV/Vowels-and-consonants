# Vowels-and-consonants
Vowels and consonants
Let's work with texts! You'll get a sequence of characters (a word, a sentence or just gibberish). For each character tell if it's a vowel or a consonant. If you hit a non-alphabetic symbol, just stop processing.

The input format:

One line with N characters.

We will use letters from the English alphabet. The symbols aeiou are considered vowels. Treat the rest of the letters as consonants.

The output format:

Print "vowel" if the character is a vowel, and "consonant" if the character is consonant. Stop printing information at the first non-alphabetic symbol.
